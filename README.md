About Something Something Marble
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple game designed to fulfill the requirements of a class project.
It is currently missing sound, and is very basic.  There are also some bugs,
but what game doesn't have bugs, especially when made ona tight time limit!

#### Known Bugs ################################################################

- Collision on the rounded corner pieces can sometimes cause you to get stuck.
- Enemies do not respawn when the character dies.
- Occasionally the jump does this weird super jump, no clue why it does that.
